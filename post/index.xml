      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok here we are. This is the first post in my new blog. I hope this space to become a share of thoughts about Software Engineering in practice. I will be posting about things I am mostly interested in, such as Web development, Information Security, System Programming or anything relative to modern Software Development Process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site will also support comments so feel free to write your oppinion as long as its not spam or trolling or hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time I plan to write tutorials that I find that they can be usefull. Also I will be writing about my personal projects that I care to explain more in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that my share of knowledge will help future developers in tackling real life issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more things about me at &lt;a href=&#34;https://theodespoudis.com&#34;&gt;https://theodespoudis.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
